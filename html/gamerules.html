                <h3>Rules of the Game</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The aim of this game is to destroy as may spaceships as you can within in a span of 90 seconds.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Destroying a spaceship involves lining up your canon towards the spaceship and firing at that spaceship to destroy it. 
                    <ul> 
                        <li>Press the left or right arrow key to line up cannon to the spaceship that you want to destroy.</li>
                        <li>Press the spacebar to destroy the spaceship that is in line with canon.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Another option to destroy a spaceship without using a keyboard is to click or tap on a UFO.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        If the spaceship that was destroyed contains the math expression that will equate to the number printed at the cannon, 
                        the attack will be a <span>HIT</span> and all the spaceships will move back to the top-most portion of the game screen.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        If the spaceship that was destroyed contains the math expression that does not equate to the number printed at the cannon, 
                        the attack will be a <span>MISS</span> and the spaceships will continue moving towards the canon.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        The game will be over when either the 90 seconds timer finishes its countdown or when any of the spaceships reaches 
                        past the tip of the cannon.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        The final score of the game will be based on the number of HITS that were recorded during the game.
                    </li>
                    
                </ul>
